# Geometry library (*geomet.py*)

This library contains several functions to generate and transform different geometries, that can go from random to solid geometry shapes.

The library is organized as follow:

***geomet***  
|  
|-->**geometry**  
|----->*regular*  
|------->Sphere  
|------->Cube  
|------->Paralelipid  
|------->Oblate  
|------->Prolate  
|  
|----->*random*  
|------->Sphere  
|------->Cube  
|  
|-->**transform**  
|----->rotation  
|----->translation
